# CodingChallenge2

This was our first coding challenge at Revature bootcamp. We had 8 hours to create a full stack application that would allow a user to create items for a grocery list.

You can see under servlets that we used a FrontController design pattern in creating the Java Servlets.

You can see from the POM file that we had not yet started learning Spring Boot.

I opted to use HTML and JS instead of Angular because I was more confident in using them at that point.
